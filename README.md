# Customer Segmentation Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on the segmentation of a company's customers based on their purchasing behavior.
The objective is to identify distinct customer profiles using historical order data.

Segmentation is based on:

- 📦 Number of orders placed  
- 💰 Total monetary value of the orders  
- 🛠️ Number of equipment units purchased  

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook using an Excel dataset as the data source.

> ⚠️ **Note**: All company names and identifying details have been anonymized to protect data privacy.
